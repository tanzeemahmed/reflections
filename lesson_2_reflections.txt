1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans : Whne we initialise a repository , a hiddnen .git folder is created which has all the 
details of the changes. We need to do it to start tracking the changes in our files.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans : The staging area acts an intermediary between the working directory and the repository.
      The working directory is where we do the actual work and when we create a snapshot , it gets saved in the repository.
      The staging area acts as an intermediary where we can move all the files we need a snapshot of and then make a commit to 
      the repository.
