When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 Ans : When I need to share my code or dcouments with others working on the same thing, I would want to share them across Github and hence have a remote repository.

 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Ans : We do not want to many  unnecessary pulls from the remot repository leading to pieces of code with logical errors.

 3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans. Forks are used to clone directories from another github repository on to your own account. This also leaves a trail unlike clone,
     where you need to clone the repository on to your local and then commit back onto your github which does not leave a trail.
     Branches are used when we need to work on  a new feature and split from an existing master branch and merge later.
