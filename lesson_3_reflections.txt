When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 Ans : When I need to share my code or dcouments with others working on the same thing, I would want to share them across Github and hence have a remote repository.

 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Ans : We do not want to many  unnecessary pulls from the remot repository leading to pieces of code with logical errors.
